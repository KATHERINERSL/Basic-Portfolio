        <h2>About Me</h2>

            <img src="assets/images/facepic.jpg" id="about-me-facepic" width="200"height="233"/>
            <p>People think that I am strange, but I say I am excentric. I was born and raised in ocala Florida,
             I wouldn't actually call it a small town but for some reason everyone seems to know eachother.</p>
            <p>Being the only girl with 3 brothers I would say that I was spoiled. not only I have the best brothers in the world but I also adopted
             other "brothers" within my Family unit.</p>
         
             <p>when I was 9 years old I had the pleasure of watching a beautiful ballet production
             of swans and doomed romance, I felt that it was so cool to be able to tell a story with not words but graceful body movement.
             From that moment I was hooked, next thing I knew I was taking classes 5 days a week. We were so involed that I started traveling 
             and teaching dance at various dance conventions Domestically and Internationally. My mom even made the decision to Homeschool me so 
             I can travel and not miss out. I have danced for over 20 years but lost the passion a small while ago, I take classes here and there
             but not as much as I did before. </p>
             
             <p>Because I was Homeschooled I feel the social awkwardness that comes from not talking much to Kids my own age,
             Which brings me to the passion of all the Nerdy! I love everything about Star Wars, star Trek, X-Files, Babylon 5, and StarGate. These
             were the things that I enjoyed the most, I even try to attend as many Comic-Cons as I can. I also have a love for Science and enjoy 
             the Sciences of the Mind and Space; I will usually read anything you put in front of me. I have yet to get married or have any children 
             other than my Fur Babies (which are the loves of my life). The current Job I have working with the Bank in Finance doesn't reflect any of my passion for anything 
             but it definitly pays the bills and that seems to be important. I am also very adveturous, I own a motorcycle and love to ride when the weather is agreeable.
              That's pretty much all you need to know about me, all I would say is keep the childlike mind and hold off growing up for as lons as you possible can.</p>
